The setting of my game takes place in an under water fantasy land. The characters wear human clothes and do human things. There are ship wrecks, schools, forests, and more. I tried experimenting with the get that cat puzzle where the cat moves around and you have to catch it. However, I couldn’t really find a way to incorporate it into my story. Instead, I created computer players that helped with my puzzle. I also was going to use the puzzle with the locked box and a key, but I decided not to since my story already had enough puzzles. I made five rooms in total, the school, your home, seaweed forest, jellyfish fields, and the ship wreckage. I had many objects including a lunch box, a sandwich, a medical kit, a band-aid, a memory pill and more. Something that I learned how to do in through this project was how to make computer players. I wanted to do something a little more complicated than the box and key puzzle so I created three computer players. I got the code from a day for spelling (Ron) and implemented it into my game. I feel that the most helpful resource that I used was other games’ code. Get that cat and a day for spelling really helped me with the coding that I didn’t know.
