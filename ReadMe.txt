I decided to choose a writing prompt that makes you use three things. A car with a broken tail light, a cigarette machine filled with something besides cigarettes, and a mysterious coin. I decided to choose this prompt because it seemed interesting and unique. I liked the idea of a coin so I decided to make my extension currency in the game. My game idea is, your car just got smashed into a tree and it is broken. You have to find money to get the new car parts from the vending machine. You then have to give them to the car repair man (NPC) to fix your car. Of course, there will be some obstacles and puzzles in finding the money and getting the parts. You win this game by giving all the car parts to the car repair man. Your win when he fixes your car so you can drive it again. Some puzzles I have is helping a thirsty runner out, finding the money in the game, and fixing your car. I have three NPCs in my game, the store clerk, the repair guy and the hurt runner.
